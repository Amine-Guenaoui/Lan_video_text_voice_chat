 it's created using java networking (rmi and probably more) .
to launch the server :
set the next files in build\classes:
change the ip addresses to your computer ip address in StartRmi.bat .
run StartRmi.bat .
then run StartServer.bat .
to launch the app :
set the files in dist/.
set the path to your opencv.dll file in your computer in runclient.bat.
run runClient.bat 

if the app doesn't work probably the ipaddresses aren't set in the code , you can set the ip address in the code , in all the files .
